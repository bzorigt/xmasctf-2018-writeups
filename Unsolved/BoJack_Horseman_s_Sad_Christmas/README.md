## Solution

There are only 2 colors, so I extracted them as binary.

I got stuck because it yielded no flags

After event:

- Solution was actually to [save it to a file and the output will be a JPG file](https://github.com/ClemensKnights/Writeups/tree/master/xmasctf/bojack-horsemans-sad-christmas)
